# DragonLens:
DragonLens is a modern, powerful, highly-customizable, community-driven cheat and debugging mod for TModLoader. It offers all of your favorite features from previous similar mods such as HEROs mod, CheatSheet, and Modders Toolkit; with a fully customizable UI layout and consistent, beautiful UI design.

For a long time, both players looking for 'creative' like utilities or cheats, and modders looking to test their mods have had to install a litany of different, separate mods to get all of the functionality they needed. This resulted in them having to manage multiple different tools, each with wildly different layouts and visual styles. This would cause problems when UIs overlapped, or sometimes were just plain ugly (looking at you MTK...). My goal with this project is to implement modern versions of these tools, with the power that users want and mod developers need. Not only have the various tools been updated to match 1.4 content (full support for 1.4s new weather system!), the layout of the GUI is Fully customizable! In addition, Every tool can be assigned a hotkey!
